Ping is a social, local, mobile app that encourages people to spend more time together in person. The app allows users to create and join events in their local area, such as dinners, hikes, or concerts. Users can also see events that their friends are attending and join them. The app provides a platform for users to connect with others who share similar interests and make new friends. Ping aims to combat social isolation and promote face-to-face interactions in an increasingly digital world.
