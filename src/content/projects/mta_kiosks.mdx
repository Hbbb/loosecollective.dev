The MTA Kiosks project was a collaboration between the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and the Parsons School of Design. The goal of the project was to design and implement new kiosks for the New York City subway system. The kiosks would provide information to passengers about train schedules, delays, and service changes, as well as general information about the subway system.
