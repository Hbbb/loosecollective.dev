Over the years, we've tried many different technologies and tools to build our projects. We've tried many different stacks, and we've learned a lot from each one. But we've never found the perfect stack. Until now.

## What is the Golden Stack?

The Golden Stack is a set of technologies and tools that we believe are the best for building modern web applications. It's the stack that we use for all of our projects, and we think it's the best stack out there. Lets define what we mean by "best":

- **Productivity**: The stack should make it easy to build and maintain web applications.
- **Performance**: The stack should be fast and efficient.
- **Reliability**: The stack should be stable and reliable.
- **Flexibility**: The stack should be flexible and allow us to build a wide range of applications.
- **Community**: The stack should have a strong community and ecosystem.

The Golden Stack has all of those qualities in spades. An additional benefit we've found is that because it's mostly relying on plain technologies (e.g. plain SQL, plain HTML, simple JS), it's very effective for LLM-assisted development.


## So, what is the stack?
