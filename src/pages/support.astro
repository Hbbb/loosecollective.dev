        <strong>What is the deal with that grid of dots?</strong>
        <p>
          The dot grid is a visual representation of your meditation streak.
          Each column represents a week, and each dot is a day you meditated.
          The color corresponds to the amount of minutes meditated in total that
          day. The more time you spend meditating, the darker that dot will be.

        <strong>Can I use this app without creating an account?</strong>
        <p>
          Yes! You can skip the account creation flow and use the timer only.
          However, mt will not track your meditation history unless you have an
          account.

        <strong>Why isn't my meditation history saving?</strong>
        <p>
          Ensure that you are logged in and have an active internet connection
          when ending a session.
